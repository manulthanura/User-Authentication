# Introduction
Creating a user registration form employs the management of the registered user. This is where user role authentication comes into play. Role authentication ensures that non-admin users cannot make changes or access exclusive information. It grants administrative privileges to admin users and basic privileges to basic users.

You can build your own authentication functionality with web tokens like JSON Web Token (JWT) or use a trusted third-party customer identity and access management (CIAM) software like LoginRadius.

# Goal
This tutorial helps you:

- understand the differences between the Admin role and the Basic user role;
- use JWT to authenticate users;
- learn role-based authentication using JWT in a simple Node.js app.

# Prerequisites
You have installed the following:

- Node JS
- MongoDB
- a Text Editor (VS Code, Atom, Sublime, etc.)

You already understand JavaScript E56 Syntax.
